## Hello :upside_down_face:

This repo holds my Emacs configuration.  I mostly try to use ELPA for
3rd party libraries, however over the years I have grown accustomed to
some libraries that are not maintained any more.  I have vendored them
in here.  They are *not* my work, and are available here under their
original licenses.  There is a list of these libraries below.  I also
use a few other external libraries, that are still maintained (or I
think so because I haven't checked) but are not available on ELPA, I
keep these available outside of the repo and simlink into the
`load-path`.

The `nifty` library is written by me.

This repository also includes the `dark-emacs` colour theme.  It
utilises the theming engine built into newer Emacs, To use it, you
will need Emacs 24 or above.

### 3rd party libraries not from ELPA
Libraries outside the repo:

Orphaned libraries:
